		<h2>Background :</h2>
		<p>I'm a FOSS developer familiar with a few different languages. I make software for fun.</p>
		<h2>Experience :</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>HTML</dt>
			<dd>I make webpages as my hobby. I've got a few projects online, at my <a href="http://github.com/infoburp/">GitHub</a></dd>
			<dt>CSS</dt>
			<dd>I am not a fan of CSS. It has a habit of getting in the way of what you're trying to do. That said, I can write basic CSS.</dd>
			<dt>JavaScript</dt>
			<dd>I have written a number of fairly advanced JavaScript programs, both client-side and server-side, using node.js. My code always works on my machine &trade;.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h2>Goals :</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Improve my knowledge of the core HTML tags.</p></li>
			<li><p>Improve my knowledge of CSS, to the point that I no longer see it as a tool designed to stop my page from looking the way I want it to.</p></li>
			<li><p>Improve my knowledge of PHP (I've not used it much, but it seems fairly similar to C++, from what I've seen).</p></li>
		</ul>
